# Defining Terms: Patterns ✅

Patterns are common idioms, ways of doing things in a language or framework that are usually good.

---

# Defining Terms: Antipatterns ❌

Antipatterns are common idioms, ways of doing things in a language or framework that are usually suboptimal.

Not exactly _wrong_, per se.

# On to the patterns ...

---

## ❌ Sleeping

- Never the _right_ amount of time
    - Sometimes doesn't wait long enough
    - Sometimes waits too long
- "Flaky" (testing lingo)
- [Discouraged](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-wait-for-timeout) in Playwright
- [Removed](https://stackoverflow.com/a/77078430/6243352) in Puppeteer

## ✅ Using a precise predicate

- locators
- `page.waitForSelector()`
- `page.waitForFunction()`
- `page.waitForResponse()`
- `page.waitForURL()`
- ...

<small>[Read more](https://stackoverflow.com/a/73676564/6243352)</small>

---

## ❌ Not using `"domcontentloaded"`

- `"load"`
    - Waits for initial set of resources
    - Can get stuck (see [this weird case](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78490582/why-is-playwright-screenshot-timing-out-with-waiting-for-fonts-to-load/78490782?noredirect=1#comment138481703_78490782))
    - Default predicate (poor design?)
- `"networkidle"`
    - Waits for even more resources, then sleeps for 500ms
    - Can get stuck
    - Slow, pessimistic, too general, flaky
    - OK-ish for PDF generation and screenshots.

## ✅ Using `"domcontentloaded"`

- Only waits for the HTML file
- Doesn't get stuck
- Quickest navigation resolver in Puppeteer
- `"commit"` is even faster in Playwright!

<small>[Read more](https://serpapi.com/blog/puppeteer-antipatterns/#never-using-domcontentloaded)</small>

---

## ❌ Using `{timeout: 0}` on navs

- Can hang the script forever
- No stack trace
- Hard to debug
- Sign of desperation

## ✅ Using `{timeout: 120_000}`

- Throw, catch, log and retry operation
- Or log the error for the maintainer to fix and crash
- Caveat: some Pupp/PW stack traces are hard to understand and debug (and the error names change every few versions just because). Next talk...?

<small>[Read more](https://blog.appsignal.com/2023/02/08/puppeteer-in-nodejs-common-mistakes-to-avoid.html#using-infinite-timeouts)</small>

---

## ❌ Not blocking resources (CSS, fonts, GA, etc)

- Don't need 'em if you're scraping text
- Slow
- Can get stuck
- Not nice to the server

## ✅ Blocking resources

- Speeds up the code!
- If the page is static, disable JS!
- A bit more code to write
- Less useful in testing

<small>[Read more](https://serpapi.com/blog/puppeteer-antipatterns/#not-blocking-images-and-resources)</small>

---

### ❌ Element Handles

```js
const titleHandles = await page.$$(".title");
const textContents = [];

for (const el of titleHandles) {
  textContents.push(await el.evaluate(el => el.textContent));
}
```

### ✅ `$$eval` (in Puppeteer)

```js
const textContents = await page.$$eval(
  ".title",
  elements => elements.map(el => el.textContent)
);
```

### ✅ `locators` (in Playwright)

```js
const textContents = await page.locator(".title").allTextContents();
```

---

## ❌ Scraping the DOM

- Liable to change
- Timing issues
- Visibility issues
- Other selection issues (Tailwind? Shadow DOM? IFrames?)
- Data is often formatted weirdly
- ...All right, sometimes you have to

## ✅ Intercepting network requests or scraping JSON

- More likely to be stable
- Faster code execution
- Gets you raw, unformatted data
- ...But not always feasible

<small>[Read more](https://stackoverflow.com/a/76023261/6243352)</small>

---

### ❌ Using browser automation on static sites

- Overkill
- ...Sometimes necessary if you're detected

### ✅ Using `fetch` + Cheerio on static sites

```js
fetch(url)
  .then(res => res.text())
  .then(html => {
    const $ = cheerio.load(html);
    const data = [...$("table")].map(e =>
      [...$(e).find("tr:has(td)")].map(e =>
        [...$(e).find("td")].map(e => $(e).text().trim())
      )
    );
    console.table(data);
  })
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
```

- Lightweight, fast, easier (synchronous) coding, fewer deps
- Potentially more reliable
- Gets you raw, unformatted data
- ...But not always feasible

<small>(I have [dozens](https://stackoverflow.com/a/78376148/6243352) of examples of speedups replacing Cheerio with Puppeteer)</small>

---

## ❌ Using trusted clicks when scraping

```js
const el = await page.$eval(".foo", el => el.click());
await el.click()
```

- Can get stuck due to visibility checks
    - Button is under cookie banner? Timeout!
- Makes you want to use evil Element Handles in Puppeteer
- Use in testing, though (we want to act like a user)

## ✅ Using untrusted clicks when scraping

```js
await page.waitForSelector(".foo");
await el.evaluate(el => el.click());
```

- General principle: No obligation to act like a user when scraping
- Way more reliable
- No visibility/actionability checks
    - Button is under cookie banner? No prob.
- Avoid in testing (we want to act like a user)

<small>[Read more](https://stackoverflow.com/a/78376148/6243352)</small>

---

## ❌ Clicking to navigate when scraping

```js
const navP = page.waitForNavigation({waitUntil: "domcontentloaded"});
await page.click(".btn-that-goes-to-next-page");
await navP; // should be waiting for a selector on the next page anyway...
```

- Avoid the DOM--it's a common source of failure
- Avoid element handles
- Also avoid `page.back()`

## ✅ Using `page.goto()` when scraping

```js
await page.goto("URL for the next page", {waitUntil: "domcontentloaded"});
```

- General principle: No obligation to act like a user when scraping
- General principle: Avoid the DOM when scraping
- Way more reliable
- No visibility/actionability checks
- Avoid in testing (we want to act like a user)

<small>[Read more](https://blog.appsignal.com/2023/06/14/puppeteer-in-nodejs-more-antipatterns-to-avoid.html#adding-premature-abstractions#underusing-pagegoto)</small>

---

## ❌ Dismissing cookie banners with `.click()`

- Timing problems, nondeterminism and flakiness

## ✅ Rip out cookie banners with `.remove()`

- General principle: No obligation to act like a user when scraping
- General principle: Avoid the DOM when scraping
- Just blast away the cookie banner
- No visibility/actionability checks
- Avoid annoying animations
- Feel free to rip out other annoying parts of the page

<small>[Read more](https://stackoverflow.com/a/78414695/6243352)</small>

---

## ❌ Using `.filter` (Playwright-specific)

```js
// from https://stackoverflow.com/a/73216189/6243352
page
  .locator(`[aria-controls=${table_id}]`)
  .filter({ has: page.locator(`text="${page_number}"`) });
```

General principle: nesting bad.

## ✅ Chaining locators

```js
// from https://stackoverflow.com/a/75553716/6243352
page
  .locator(`[aria-controls="${tableId}"]`)
  .getByText(pageNumber, {exact: true});
```

---

#### ❌ Using `.locator`

- Not specific enough
- Makes you want to use CSS or XPath (not user-visible)

#### ❌ Using `.getByText`

- OK-ish--at least it's user visible
- `getByRole` is better because it also specifies the role

#### ❌ Using `.getByTestId`

- OK-ish--at least it's specific
- Pollutes the code with `data-testid="..."` attrs everywhere
- Not user-visible

#### ✅ Using `.getByRole`

- Specify both text/placeholder/value and element with unified syntax
- User-visible

(This has to do more with testing--use whatever seems most reliable for a particular site if you're scraping... but you're probably using Puppeteer for scraping anyway)

---

## ❌ Using `page.on` to get one response

- General principle: nesting bad
- Easy to [leak listeners](https://stackoverflow.com/a/74660359/6243352)
- Callback-based
- Useful for monitoring all requests

## ✅ Using `.waitForResponse`/`.waitForRequest`

- Promise based, nice and flat, control flow stays in a chain

---

## ❌ Not taking advantage of the API

- Still selecting text with XPath (already covered)
- Traversing shadow DOMs by hand
- Using `page.$` and family (element handles)

## ✅ Using new features (Puppeteer)

- `::-p-text(foobar)` to select text (`text/foobar` was cool but now is "legacy")
- `&gt;&gt;&gt;` to traverse the shadow DOM
- Maybe non-experimental locators someday? In the meantime, `page.waitForSelector()` with `page.$$eval()` handles 90% of the work.

## ✅ Using new features (Playwright)

- Heed the warnings in the docs!

---

## ❌ Using XPath

- Nasty syntax, usually unnecessary, hard to maintain
- No longer necessary for text content scraping (use `::-p-text()` in Pupp, `textContent()` in PW)

## ✅ Using `::-p-`/CSS selectors (in Puppeteer)

- Fine for scraping, if chosen carefully (see next slide)
- Pupp locators are still experimental at the moment

## ✅ Using `getByRole` (in Playwright)

- Great for testing

---

#### ❌ Using long path or CSS chains

- Really brittle:

    ```js
    "#answer-60796572 &gt; div &gt; div.answercell &gt; div.s-prose.js-post-body &gt; pre"
    ```
  
#### ✅ Using short CSS selectors (in scraping/Pupp)

- Better (assuming it's enough to disambiguate the element):

    ```js
    "#answer-60796572 .js-post-body pre"
    ```
- Difficult to choose properly. Find the right balance:
  - Precise enough that it's unlikely to match the wrong thing (_false positive_)
  - Loose enough that it doesn't assume a rigid DOM structure that's liable to break (_false negative_)

#### ✅ Using `getByRole` (in testing/PW)

- ...or one of the many other Playwright location best practices

---

#### ❌ Using CSS attribute selectors unnecessarily

- Really brittle:

    ```js
    '[class="foo"]'
    ```
- This is too precise (prone to false negatives)
- This won't match `<p class="foo bar"></p>`
- Occasionally useful, like matching
    ```html
    <p class="foo-17da983d49324bd"></p>
    ```
    with `'[class^=foo-]'`.
  
#### ✅ Using CSS `.` syntax

- Better:

    ```js
    ".foo"
    ```

- This will match

    ```html
    <p class="foo bar"></p>
    ```

---

## ❌ Mixing `await`/`then`

- Not just Pupp/PW but since these libs are heavily async, tends to show up here
- [Hall of Shame](https://stackoverflow.com/a/75785234/6243352) of collected problems this has caused, too many to list here
- General principle: nesting bad.

## ❌ Using `.then` instead of `await` in Puppeteer/PW

## ✅ Just use `await`

---

### ❌ Overusing `networkidle`

- Already mentioned, slow, unreliable, pessimistic and has a sleep

### ✅ Use specific predicates

- `waitForResponse`, `waitForSelector`, `waitForFunction`... precise!
- See [this example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57364320/puppeteers-setcontent-function-not-making-network-requests-for-static-files/78594844#78594844) that gives a 2x speedup for screenshots/PDF gen

    ```js
    const loaded = Promise.all([
      page.waitForResponse(e =>
        e.url() === "https://unpkg.com/hack@0.8.1/dist/dark-grey.css"
      ),
      page.waitForResponse(e => e.url() === "https://picsum.photos/100/100"),
      page.waitForFunction("!!window.axios"),
      page.waitForSelector("p::-p-text(Leanne Graham)"),
    ]);
    await page.goto(url, {waitUntil: "domcontentloaded"}});
    await loaded;
    await page.evaluate(`
      Promise.all([...document.querySelectorAll("img")].map(e => e.decode()))
    `);
    ```
- Downsides: verbose, a bit more work, not as general

---

## ❌ Using overly-general methods

```js
await page.evaluate(() => {
  const elements = document.querySelectorAll(".foo-bar");
  return [...elements].map((el) => el.textContent.trim());
});
```

## ✅ Using the right tool for the job

```js
// Puppeteer
await page.$$eval(".foo-bar", (elements) => {
  return elements.map((el) => el.textContent.trim());
});
```

```js
// Playwright
await page.locator(".foo-bar").allTextContents();
```

Might seem trivial, but this applies to so many parts of the API and magnifies.

---

## ❌ Not cleaning up the browser

```js
const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
// ...
await browser.close();
```

Easy to write, but if an error is thrown, the process won't exit.

## ✅ Cleaning up the browser

```js
let browser;
try {
  browser = await puppeteer.launch();
  // ...
} catch (err) {
  console.error(err);
} finally {
  await browser?.close();
}
```

Verbose but correct.

---

## ❌ Not using `userDataDir`

- Keep having to log in again and again, possibly with 2FA
- Not nice to the server

## ✅ Using `userDataDir`

- Login (by hand, even), maybe with 2FA and save state
- Less code, great for whipping up a scrape quickly

---

## ❌ Trying to rewrite working browser code in Puppeteer when scraping

- You usually start in the browser console
- Wind up in element handle/async hell trying to rewrite
- Code stops being portable (browser DOM can run anywhere and will always be relevant to be able to write)

## ✅ Using Puppeteer as a lightweight wrapper on browser DOM manipulation

- If it already works, use it (plop into an `evaluate`)
- Throw in waits where necessary
- Scraping only!
- Caveat: sometimes you need trusted events or better application design than a dump of browser code.
  - incrementally take advantage of Puppeteer idioms where appropriate
  - and/or organize the browser code better

---

## ❌ Writing premature abstractions

- Applies to both scraping and testing
- Often too clever
- Tends to make correctness harder to establish--too many problems at once

## ✅ Abstracting only when motivation arrives

- Generally good advice
- A bit of duplication can be OK
- Abstractions have a cost
- Find the "right", clearly-motivated abstraction
- [AHA! Testing](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/aha-testing) (Kent)
- [Avoid nesting when testing](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/avoid-nesting-when-youre-testing) (Kent again)
- [Factoring your code](https://grugbrain.dev/#grug-on-factring-your-code) (Grug)

---

### ❌ Assuming there's a silver bullet

- Common question: How do I scrape any website?
  - Many variants like:
       - [When is the page completely loaded?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52497252/puppeteer-wait-until-page-is-completely-loaded/72535642#72535642)
       - [How to pick a selector?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73917113/convenient-way-to-get-input-for-puppeteer-page-click/73928661#73928661)
- Answer: it's hard. Websites throw a different curveball every time.
- If we could do this, libraries wouldn't bother with all the beating around the bush and would just give us a `scrapeAnyPagePerfectly(url)` function.
- LLMs haven't solved the problem.

### ✅ Writing site-specific code

- Sorry, generally there's no choice. Just gotta do it the hard way.
- Playwright codegen helps a bit but also not a silver bullet.

### ✅ Generalizing based on use case

- For example, using [Moz Readability](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39504105) can scrape most text-based pages pretty well (useful for RAGs).
- For tables there are one-shots, e.g. `pandas.read_html()`.

# Recap

**When scraping**...
- No obligation to act like a user
- No obligation to adhere to user-visible selectors or events
- Avoid the DOM
- "Cheating" is often good

**When testing**...
- Do the opposite of everything above.

**In both cases**:
- Auto waiting is good
- Flatter is better
- Avoid premature abstractions

**Puppeteer**: generating PDFs, screenshots, scraping. Simpler API, fewer distractions, less need to be user-visible, less opinionated.

**Playwright**: testing, assertions. More opinionated/adheres to best practices.
